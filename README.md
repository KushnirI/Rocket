If spaceship collides with the bot, rocket is returned to the start point and one life is lost, 
the bot receives damage as well. 
Game is over when all lives are lost.

You can collect lives and ammo using appropriate items. If you collected more than three lives, 
it will be shown as 3+ live on the screen, but you will still get a new life. 
Use the ammo wisely to clear the way from bots, before all bullets are gone, 
but anyway you can still ram bots to clear the way :)

When all the bots destroyed, you won.
